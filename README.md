# trike_throttle
arduino based RC motor controller for electric trike / bike
this program was designed to control the speed of a rc brushless motor using a PWM output driving a 100 amp RC brushless drive
it also measured current flow and had a working current limiting by reducing the speed requested
also had a 4 x 20 LCD display driven by I2C output displayed current, voltage, watts on the display
trike had 48 VDC 30 amp hour battery supply 
without current limitng could see 80 to 90 amps in short bursts of accelleration
